# Ragdoll Engine

## About
Ragdoll Engine is a game engine named after the ragdoll breed of cats. This is a hobby/student project that aims to share what I've learnt in my journey in developing a game engine. It will be a 3D OpenGL based application that provides a editor functionality for making games.

## Motivation
This is a personal side project I've undertaken to understand what goes into making a game engine such as Unity.
I believe that only through participating in a massive project like this, will I improve on myself and gain the experiences needed to plan ahead for future projects that I may take part in in the future.
This project may also serve as a starting point for my juniors to look at if proven to be useful enough. I would like to detail and note down the methods that I implemented as well as the reasoning behind it. These implementations are simply what I presume would be the best at the moment and would love for some feedback via the discussion board or issues, and are by no means the best.

Instead of writing my own blog, I would like to detail my journey as well as what I've learnt in the Blog folder, where it will contain all the markdown files on why and how I wrote my implementations.

## Build
TBD

## Features

## Credits
I followed Cherno's Game Engine Series when I was starting out as a student making a few game engines, and hence there may be parts of this project that will look similar to Hazel.
