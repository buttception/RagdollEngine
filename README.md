# Ragdoll Engine

## About
Ragdoll Engine is a renderer using D3D12 API via [nvrhi](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/nvrhi) abstraction layer. It will incoporate modern rendering techniques used in the current industry, and also serve as a way for me to look back at how the renderer is slowly improved over time.

## Build
Run ```pull_dependencies.bat``` followed by ```vs2022_generate.bat``` to generate the solution. Build the project using Visual Studio 2022.
